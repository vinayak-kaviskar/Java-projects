SCOPES OF A BEAN
singleton  single instance thoughout application
prototype every type a new bean is requested.
request  for every new request
session   for a http session
websocket for a websocket session.
application:  for the life cycle of servlet context, The application scope creates the bean instance for the lifecycle of a ServletContext.
This is similar to the singleton scope, but there is a very important difference with regards to the scope of the bean.
When beans are application scoped, the same instance of the bean is shared across multiple servlet-based applications running in the same ServletContext, while singleton scoped beans are scoped to a single application context only.
